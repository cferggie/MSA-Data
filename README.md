# MSA-Data
These city level crime tables are from the FBI Database from 2000-2019. 

***The files from the FBI database are not cleaned. If you want files that are cleaned for analysis, the very last file contains R code that you can use to clean the databases. My code is specifically to get the property crime data for a select cities. However, the code can be easily editted to your hearts desire.
